            <h1>Cappuccino</h1>
            <p> these kinds of beverages are generally made in cafe shops due to the type of instruments required for this recipe. Yet it can be attempted at home with the available kitchen equipment. So in this recipe, I have used a mixer blender to get the same froth and thickness that you get with a coffee machine. Well, to be honest, you may not get the same result, but still worth spending this effort compared to buying it from the cafe.</p>
